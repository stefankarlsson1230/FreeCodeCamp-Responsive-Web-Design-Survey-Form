## Responsive Web Design
### Survey Form

This was the first of five projects to achieve the *Responsive Web Design* Certificate 

[This page](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/) was what I had to recreate, and [this](https://stefankarlsson1230.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Survey-Form/) was my result.
